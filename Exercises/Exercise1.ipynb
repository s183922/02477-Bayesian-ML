    "The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with the core components of Bayesian inference: the **prior**, the **likelihood**, the **posterior** as well as manipulating probabilities.

We will study these concepts in the context of the Beta-Binomial model. \n",

    "One of the main applications of the Beta-Binomial model is to estimate proportions. For example, suppose a website shows a specific ad to $N = 112$ customers and $Y = 13$ of those custumers end up clicking on the ad. A common task is then to estimate the click-rate for this ad in order to answer questions like the following:\n",

    "2) What is the probability that the click-rate is below 10%?\n",

    "We will see how the Bayesian Beta-Binomial model can be used to answer such questions. Furthermore, we will conclude the exercise by studying a slightly more general version of the problem: Suppose a website has two ads: version A and version B and that version A was shown $N_A$ times and generated $m_A$ clicks, whereas version B was shown $N_B$ times and generated $m_B$ click.
